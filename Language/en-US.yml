Of course, we can stick to our Landspeeders until better options arise. But with enemies getting reinforcements everyday - we may find ourselves outgunned and outperformed. {NEWLINE}{NEWLINE} Right now we have an option to switch to a more durable and combat proven transport - {ALT}Rhino{ALT}, an armored personnel carrier.
