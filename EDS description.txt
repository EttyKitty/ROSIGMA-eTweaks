EDS - Experimental Damage System feature description.

1. Difficulties of communication.

The whole system is built upon scripting, because of that it's somewhat hard to communicate, at least with in-game tools. 
I (will) have to manually fill up codex pages to display all new attributes and stats.

2. A new weapon stat - "Minimum Damage".

It functions similarly to >50%<-200% damage spread. One exception - you can set it to whatever value you want, meaning you can have weapons with minimum damage of 200% base power.
It makes default power with its spread function more like a crit modifier than the bulk of the weapons damage, while also making the damage more consistent.

3. A new weapon stat - "Armor Ignore".

Again, functions similarly to an already existing system - "ArmorEffectiveness". The difference is that now armor piercing will be more consistent and logical. 

Before a weapon was piercing, for example, 20% of armor, meaning that it's 2 points (AP) against 10 armor, 20AP against 100 armor and 80AP if an armor suit had 400 armor. Pretty weird if you ask me.
Now it functions like a flat armor ignore value, meaning that 20AP is 20AP against everything. Makes armor damage somewhat more important.

Of course all "ArmorEffectiveness" will have to be set to 1.0.

4. A new soldier/armor stat - "Toughness".

This is a pretty new concept but a very simple nonetheless:
First, it makes a portion of unit's armor indestructible.
Second, it makes a portion of unit's armor unpiercable with "Armor Ignore".

Later weapons with "Toughness Ignore" may be added.

5. Weapon, Armor and unit rebalance.

Some of the player weapons, armor and units were rebalanced according to tabletop RPG's. Mainly Space Marines faction and mainly according to the DeathWatch RPG.

Transfer multipliers were as follows:
Damage = 4
Armor Ignore = 7
Armor points = 7
Health = 4
Strength = 12
Weight = 1.25
In rare cases range was also used = 0.2-0.5
Costs were untouched.
