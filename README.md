## A Short F.A.Q:
> How serious am I?

Not serious at all.
   
I'm in a good mood. I'm having fun. I do things.  
I'm in a normal mood. I'm not having fun. I don't do things.  

It's as simple as that.

> What are the branches?

> What about other factions aside from the SM?

I don't plan to change other factions, as of right now. I try to at least "not break" them, but not always and it's not my priority. 

First, I fix the SM to my liking, find my paradigms inside of every gameplay mechanic, then I will think about others. Maybe.

> How good am I with the sprite work/coding?

Very bad.

## Developers:
**EttyKitty** (**Sayurime**) - main developer. Blame me for everything.

## Credits and thanks to:
**bulletdesigner** and **ohartenstein23** - developers of the '40k' mod.  

**Buscher and Leflair** - developers of the 'ROSIGMA' submod. They helped me a lot with advises and ideas.  

**Firaa** - developer of the '40k "Melee" Weapon Pack' and 'Randomized Stat Caps for Soldiers' mods. Some of his work is used by me.  

**Dioxine** - developer of the 'X-Piratez' mod, from which I took some sprites, code parts and ideas.  

**Solarius Scorch** - developer of the 'X-Com Files' mod, from which I also took some ideas and sprites.  
Both 'X-Piratez' and 'X-Com Files' are great mods, in which I spent a lot of my time, so a separate big thanks to those guys.  

**Meridian** and **Yankes** - developers of the OXCE.  
Nothing even should be said. If not for these guys - a lot of the things simply wouldn't be possible to implement.
